# Examples for Rails Disco

This is the place for examples of the [Rails Disco](https://github.com/hicknhack-software/rails-disco) project.

* disco_blog - a simple blog project
* disco_react - demonstrates the usage of facebook [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and coffeescript component

# Getting Started

These examples just work out of the box (if they aren't broken). All you need to do is creating a database with 

    rake disco:migrate:setup

and starting the server with

    disco server
